# Computational-Finance
------------

This Github repository is based on the Computational Finance course 2020 thaught 
at the University of Amsterdam. The course revolve around how to price options (European/American and Asian options) 
using various numerical methods such as the binomial tree, Black-Scholes equation,
Monte Carlo method (including variance reduction) and partial differential equation.
In Assignment 1, the binomial tree is analysed and compared to the analytical Black-Scholes equation.
In Assignment 2, the Monte Carlo method is used to price option. Additionally, the variance reduction 
technique control variates is applied. Finally, in Assignment 3, the partial differential equation are 
applied using finite difference method such as the Forward Time Centred in Space and 
the Crank-Nicolson scheme. In each sub-directory, an report is included containng the 
necessary background information and the results got from the computation. Furhtermore, in 
each Assignment a more detailed manual is attached on how to call the different functions.
To be apple to compile the code, Python 3 needs to be installed.
