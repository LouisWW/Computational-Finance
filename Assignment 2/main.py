-computing the discounted value of the average pay-off
- convergence studies by increasing the number of trials and compare to assignment 1
- vary the strike price and the volatility

'''





'''
Estimation of Sensitivities in MC:
-Compute bump-and-reveal mehtod 
-Determine small delta 
- use different/same seed for bumped/unbumped estimate of the value
- and point 2 use sophisticated method discussed in the lecture
'''


'''
Variance Reduction:
- control variates technique on Asian option based on arithmetic average
- study performance for different number of paths/strike/number of time points, etc.
